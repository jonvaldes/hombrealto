I'm Jon Vald√©s, a computer programmer who loves simplicity and performance, lately
interested in Go, computer graphics and C/C++ (mostly C, really...).

In the past I worked as a plugins developer for [RandomControl](http://randomcontrol.com), 
and more recently as an "embarrasingly generalist engineer" for [Ludei](http://ludei.com), 
working with C++, Go, JS, Dart, Java, ObjC... and doing everything from backend services 
to game engines and performance optimizations.

Right now I'm happily unemployed, working on lots of personal projects at the same time.

Currently living in the Basque Country, a nice region in the north of Spain.
